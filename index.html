<p>
  Hey you! Yes, the incredible human reading this — today is all about <em>you</em>, and I couldn't be more excited to celebrate! 🎉<br><br>

  From your boundless kindness to that one-of-a-kind laugh that makes everything feel lighter — you're a gem of a person, Habiba. 💎<br>
  Your energy is uplifting, your heart is gold, and your presence? Simply unforgettable. 💫<br><br>

  I hope this birthday wraps you in love, fills your heart with joy, and gives you memories that make you smile for years to come. May this year be full of spontaneous adventures, inside jokes, late-night talks, and the kind of peace that comes from knowing you're surrounded by people who truly care. 💕<br><br>

  Here's to more laughter, more growth, more breakthroughs, and more snack-fueled rants about everything and nothing at all. 🧁🗯️<br><br>

  Keep shining, Habiba. You make life better just by being you — and that’s a pretty amazing superpower to have. ✨<br><br>

  <strong>Happy Birthday, my friend!</strong> 🥳<br>
